My notes
----------------
for chrome extension: what are people browsing most? political ones? all the crazy stuff that's happening in the world?
think more about use cases and experience for the user
look at toronto deep learning example for ideas about how to construct the sentence
idea of the absent image / invisible image
look at interesting JPG bot
how context is lost
absent image makes you imagine what's there
also the idea of traces


Hub Feedback
----------------
what is the statement i am trying to make?
am i trying to make a political statement? what is your voice, what are you trying to say?
what is the call to action? why you should download the app
also keep it simple
remove all the nouns
could do it as a twitter bot, experiment with that different format
idea: people who upload selfies on twitter, or uploads a photo of themselves, give them a photo of something
how could i make the selfie generic? give people a description of themselves
also could play around with the twitter bot as a different form



Abhi Feedback
----------------
on NYTimes, they have an alt tag on the image to describe exactly what the image is about
could use something like that in the mashup 
trump -- it could be "this is an image of trump"
how specific do i want to be? another approach
  - take the image
  - do a query to tineye or something with similar images
  - create a group of images that are similar images
  - take a group of the images, feed them through clarifai and get all the tags
  - see the most common tags and then construct the sentence from there
  - that way it's not totally random
start it off as a twitter bot
  - tweet an image
  - or pick randomly an image, tweet back the description of the image
  - trending images from twitter and then describe them in 140 characters or less
and then make a chrome extension as a secondary thing for people to download
  - removes all image
  - image to text chrome extension
placeholder image should be its own image, add a little rebecca copyright at the bottom
idea of making a new image
node modules to create images from text (and put a copyright on it as well)



Ross and Jason Feedback
----------------------------
add indefinite article in front of the second noun
like the simplicity
could use wordnik top exampl
love to see the option for a lot more depth of the text
jason likes simple intro + what if you could click to see more to understand about the image
contextual background + cultural reference points (ie http://www.imageatlas.org/)
replacing the image with a full paragraph rather than a box, that way it changes the layout of the website
ross: could make it a bookmarklet -- easier than chrome extension
jason: could conjoin it with something that people actually need (not as laborious as a chrome extension)



Oryan Feedback
----------------------------
could be a useful tool for blind people to provide a description of the image
array of tags - which of these is the closest one? could be a gamey way
maybe you can click to be able to bring back the picture
or maybe it's more difficult to bring it back
instagram or a platform that's just for pictures
what if you went to instagram and it was all just descriptions of absent images (related to ross's camera)
a new social media, text-a-gram, images of descriptions of images
i'm interested in the one-sentence description



Sweta Feedback
----------------------------
would be nice if you could go back and see what the image was? imagination is nie
context free grammar -- look at examples for this
give it a few different sentence structures rather than the just one to breathe life into it a bit more
you can do part of speech tagging in rita
want to be able to imagine what it is
want there to be enough description that it will spark the imagination (vagueness will be nice)
how can i make it poetic
to think about: text that you're generating and the sentiment of it
playing around with the parts of speech and context free grammar
model photo -- sees the water, not the main thing in the image; weighting with in it



Craig Feedback
----------------------------
likes the simplicity
does it change every time?
fun game element OR takes it more seriously and decontextualizes more seriously 
images / taking away context
removing the option of having the image to supplement the words
idea of swapping images based on the description
"this is politics, an image of law enforcement"
how machine is interpreting what it's seeing and how we interpret the machine's interpretation of the image -- using the machine's description as a way to get a different image
  - the machine sees the content not the context
idea of how it works in a social media context (seeing your own images) or a political / news context



Daria Feedback
----------------------------
how do you turn it off and go back to see the image
trying it on facebook / familiar images
keep it as a chrome extension
social things
pinterest - places where there are grids of images
idea of browsing pinterest with words -- or tumblr -- would that be interesting?
"image overload"
would using words be more easily digestible?
should color play into it at all? do you take the dominant color from the picture and make the background that color?
  - look up pixar colorscript
  - shows mood of whole thing
  - goes back to averaging project



Shiffman's Feedback
----------------------------
what i have now is very different than what is o
you come to the page, press a button and the images go away
you come to the page and it loads, there are these placeholder sentences
can you reverse it, do you want to undo the action?
simplicity is really nice (unlike the stuff that Ross is doing)
short things, feels important that it's an accurate sentence
NLP compromise package will be good for this -- will tell you if the word is plural or not -- matching tense, articles, etc.
the vibe is not wrong and robotic
context is so important
will be different when it's in the page with lots of other stuff
one thing technically will be difficult is on the page -- finding images, but what about ads and stuff?
start with one website and build it out fully, for nytimes.com and then i'll put it on other sites
  - eventually you can build it out
  - addie's project can target github
  - constraint of showing it next week
  - targeting is good
for next week: pick either social media site, nytimes, or something 
  - instagram is a good place to start
  - visual treatment that i use will play an important role
  - want it to feel like a placeholder image
  - absence is important
  - might need some small indicator that there was a visual there -- border, etc. you can play around with
